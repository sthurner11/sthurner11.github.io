### Current Research
Working with my advisor [Dr. Trevor Branch](https://fish.uw.edu/faculty/trevor-branch/), I use computer simulations to understand if — and when — the human harvest of economically valuable species can lead to extinction. As a part of this project, we are building a public database that contains trends in the relative abundance of various species from different fishery-independent surveys.

Working with Dr. André Punt and Dr. Charlotte Boyd, we are completing a research strategy analysis for the aerial surveys of Cook Inlet Belugas to improve population monitoring.
